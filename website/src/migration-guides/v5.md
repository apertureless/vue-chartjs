# Migration from v4 to v5

With v5, this library introduces a number of breaking changes

## ESM

### v5.0

Chart.js v4 and vue-chartjs v5 are [ESM-only packages](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html). To use them in your project, it also should be ESM:

```json
// package.json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

If you are experiencing this problem with Jest, you should follow [this doc](https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules) to enable ESM support. Or, we can recommend you migrate to [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). Vitest has ESM support out of the box and [has almost the same API as Jest](https://vitest.dev/guide/migration.html#migrating-from-jest). [Here is our example of migration](https://github.com/reactchartjs/react-chartjs-2/commit/7f3ec96101d21e43cae8cbfe5e09a46a17cff1ef).


### v5.1

Chart.js v4.1 and vue-chartjs v5.1 have restored the CommonJS support.

## API changes

- `chartData` props were renamed to `data`
- `chartOptions` props were renamed to `options`
- unknown props will fall through to the canvas element.
- `generateChart` were refactored and renamed to `createTypedChart`
- Vue.js < 2.7 is no longer supported. If you want to use vue-chartjs with Vue < 2.7 you have to lock your version to 4.x.
