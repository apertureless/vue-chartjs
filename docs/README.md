# vue-chartjs
**vue-chartjs** is a wrapper for [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js) in Vue. You can easily create reusable chart components.

## Introduction
`vue-chartjs` lets you use Chart.js without much hassle inside Vue. It's perfect for people who need simple charts up and running as fast as possible.

It abstracts the basic logic but exposes the Chart.js object to give you maximal flexibility.

## Installation
If you are working with Vue.js 2+ simple run:

`yarn add vue-chartjs chart.js`

If you are using vue 1.x please use the `legacy` tag. However the Vue 1 version is not maintained anymore.

`yarn add vue-chartjs@legacy`

## Quick Start

You need to import the base chart and extend it. This gives more flexibility when working with different data.
You can encapsulate your components and use props to pass data or you can input them directly inside the component. However your component is not reusable this way.

You can import the whole package or each module individual.

```javascript
// CommitChart.js
import { Bar } from 'vue-chartjs'

export default {
  extends: Bar,
  mounted () {
    // Overwriting base render method with actual data.
    this.renderChart(data, options)
  }
}
```

You can pass two arguments to the `renderChart()` method:

- Data object
- Options object

### Data object

The data object looks like this:

```javascript
{
  labels: ['January', 'February'],
  datasets: [
    {
      label: 'GitHub Commits',
      backgroundColor: '#f87979',
      data: [40, 20]
    }
  ]
}
```

For more information take a look at the [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/#chart-configuration-chart-data) docs.

## Props

There are some basic props defined in the BaseCharts. Because you `extend()` them, they are *invisible*, but you can overwrite them:

| Prop | Description |
|---|---|
| width | chart width |
| height | chart height |
| chart-id | id of the canvas |
| css-classes | String with css classes for the surrounding div |
| styles | Object with css styles for the surrounding div container |

## Examples

Here are some examples

### Chart with props

You can create data and options props to pass data to the chart.

```javascript
// LineChart.js
import { Line } from 'vue-chartjs'

export default {
  extends: Line,
  props: ['data', 'options'],
  mounted () {
    this.renderChart(this.data, this.options)
  }
}
```

After you add your component you can use it:

```html
 <line-chart data="{your data object}" options="{your options}"></line-chart>
```

If you want to overwrite width and height:

```html
 <line-chart
  data="{your data object}"
  options="{responsive: false, maintainAspectRatio: false}"
  width="400"
  height="200"
  >
 </line-chart>
```
<p class="info">
  For dynamic property binding, use the v-bind: directive or : shorthand syntax
</p>

<p class="warning">
  Please keep in mind, that you have to set `responsive: false` to be able to set a fixed `width` and `height`.
</p>

### Chart with local data

```javascript
import {Bar} from 'vue-chartjs'

export default {
  extends: Bar,
  data () {
    return {
      datacollection: {
        labels: ['January', 'February'],
        datasets: [
          {
            label: 'Data One',
            backgroundColor: '#f87979',
            data: [40, 20]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  mounted () {
    this.renderChart(this.datacollection, {responsive: true, maintainAspectRatio: false})
  }
}
```

### Reusable Components

If you want to keep your chart components reusable, it's the best to add a wrapper to them. This way the chart component is only responsible for the pure data representation and the wrapper component for the logic behind it. There are many different use cases and it is different if you're running a single page application or integrate it in for example laravel.

## Reactive Data

Chart.js does not provide a live update if you change the datasets. However `vue-chartjs` provides two mixins to achieve this.

- `reactiveProp`
- `reactiveData`

Both mixins do actually achieve the same. Most of the time you will use `reactiveProp`. It extends the logic of your chart component and automatically creates a prop named `chartData` and adds a `vue watch` on this prop. On data change, it will either call `update()` if only the data inside the datasets has changed or `renderChart()` if new datasets were added.

`reactiveData` simply creates a local chartData variable which is not a prop! and adds a watcher. This is only useful, if you need single purpose charts and make an API call inside your chart component.

```javascript
data () {
  return {
    chartData: null
  }
}
```

### Example

**LineChart.js**
```javascript
import { Line, mixins } from 'vue-chartjs'
const { reactiveProp } = mixins

export default {
  extends: Line,
  mixins: [reactiveProp],
  props: ['options'],
  mounted () {
    // this.chartData is created in the mixin.
    // If you want to pass options please create a local options object
    this.renderChart(this.chartData, this.options)
  }
}
```

**RandomChart.vue**

```javascript
<template>
  <div class="small">
    <line-chart :chart-data="datacollection"></line-chart>
    <button @click="fillData()">Randomize</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import LineChart from './LineChart.js'

  export default {
    components: {
      LineChart
    },
    data () {
      return {
        datacollection: null
      }
    },
    mounted () {
      this.fillData()
    },
    methods: {
      fillData () {
        this.datacollection = {
          labels: [this.getRandomInt(), this.getRandomInt()],
          datasets: [
            {
              label: 'Data One',
              backgroundColor: '#f87979',
              data: [this.getRandomInt(), this.getRandomInt()]
            }, {
              label: 'Data One',
              backgroundColor: '#f87979',
              data: [this.getRandomInt(), this.getRandomInt()]
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      getRandomInt () {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * (50 - 5 + 1)) + 5
      }
    }
  }
</script>

<style>
  .small {
    max-width: 600px;
    margin:  150px auto;
  }
</style>
```

<p class="warning">
  ⚠ Attention: If you mutate your data in a parent component and pass it to your child chart component keep the javascript limitations in mind.
  More info in this [issue#44](https://github.com/apertureless/vue-chartjs/issues/44)

  </ul>

## Chart.js object

Sometimes you need more control over Chart.js. That's why you can access the Chart.js instance over `this.$data._chart`.

## Inline plugins

In Chart.js you can define global and inline plugins. Global plugins are working without problems with `vue-chartjs` like in the [Chart.js docs](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/developers/plugins.html) described.

If you want to add inline plugins, `vue-chartjs` exposes a helper method called `addPlugin()`
You should call `addPlugin()` before the `renderChart()` method.

### Example

```javascript
mounted () {
  this.addPlugin({
    id: 'my-plugin',
    beforeInit: function (chart) {
      ....
    }
  })
}
```

## Available Charts

### Bar Chart
<p class="tip">
  There are two versions of the Bar chart: `{Bar}` and `{HorizontalBar}`
</p>

## Explanation of Different Builds
There are three different entry points. It depends on your build setup. The dependencies are bundled or required as a peerDependency.

- Browser
- Browserify / Webpack 1
- Webpack 2


| Build | Chart.js | Vue.js |
|---|---|---|
| vue-chartjs.full.js | Bundled | Bundled |
| vue-chartjs.full.min.js |  Bundled | Bundled  |
| vue-chartjs.js | peerDependency | peerDependency  |
| vue-chartjs.min.js | peerDependency  | peerDependency  |
| es/index* |  peerDependency | peerDependency  |

### Browser
You can use `vue-chartjs` directly in the browser without any build setup, like in this [codepen](https://codepen.io/apertureless/pen/vxWbqB?editors=1010). In this case, please use the `vue-chartjs.full.min.js` which is the minified version. It has Vue.js and Chart.js bundled into it and is bundled to a UMD module, so you only need that one file.


### Browserify / Webpack 1

If you're using Gulp, Browserify or Webpack 1 the entry is `vue-chartjs.js` which is __transpiled__ and __bundled__ UMD Module.

However Vue.js and Chart.js are `peerDependencies` so you have to install them separately. In most projects you will have Vue.js already installed anyways. This way, you can have different versions of Vue.js and Chart.js then in this package.

### Webpack 2
If you're using Webpack 2 it will automatically use the `jsnext:main` / `module` entry point, which is `es/index.js`. It is a __transpiled__ es version of the source and is not __bundled__ to a module. This way your tree shaking will work.  Like in the bundled version, Vue.js and Chart.js are `peerDependencies` and need to be installed.
